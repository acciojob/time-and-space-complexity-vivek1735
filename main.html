	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with better time complexity is considered more efficient because it can handle larger inputs in less time.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. An efficient algorithm not only considers time but also minimizes memory usage. A common space complexity is O(n), where the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
